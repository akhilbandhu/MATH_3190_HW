## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r question1 0, eval=F}
#' Function to read in the data
#' 
#' @param fileUrl the file we are reading from
#'
#' @export
#'
#' @return The function will return basketball data as a tibble
#' 

read_function <- function(fileUrl) {
  basketball_data <- as_tibble(read.fwf(fileUrl, widths=c(11,24,3,23,4,4,21)))
  return(basketball_data)
}

```

```{r basketball}
# 'http://kenpom.com/cbbga22.txt'
View(basketball_data)
getwd()
```

Tackling question 3 
Every code snippet is for one of the parts of the question

Part a)
Mutate where the game was played into a new column
We are just going to use the second name column to do this

The second piece of the code is to get the difference in the scores
The absolute value function is used to not get any negative scores

```{r function3a 0, eval=F}
#' create a new column that designates were each game was
#' played. Also create a column that gives the score differences (team1âˆ’team2)
#' 
#' Mutate where the game was played into a new column
#' We are just going to use the second name column to do this
#'
#' The second piece of the code is to get the difference in the scores
#' The absolute value function is used to not get any negative scores
#' @param basketball_data the data frame we are using to do the manipulation
#'
#' @export
#' 
#' @examples
#' R code here showing how your function works

mutate_function <- function(basketball_data) {
  basketball_data <- basketball_data %>%
    mutate(Venue = V4)
  basketball_data <- basketball_data %>% 
    mutate(score_difference = (abs(V3-V5)))
  View(basketball_data)
}

```



Arrange in ascending 
change to desc(Venue) to arrange in descending order

```{r function3b 0, eval = F}
#' Arranging the data by where the game was played and in descending order
#' 
#' change to desc(Venue) to arrange in descending order
#'
#' @param basketball_data the data frame we are using to do the manipulation
#'
#' @export
#' 

arrange_func <- function(basketball_data) {
   return(basketball_data %>% arrange((Venue)))
}
```

```{r question3b}
basketball_data %>% arrange((Venue))

```

Removing the 6th and 7th columns
As of now the columns have not been named so just using V6 and V7 
in the select function.

```{r function3c 0, eval = F}
#' Removing the 6th and 7th columns from the basketball dataset
#' 
#' As of now the columns have not been named so just using V6 and V7 
#'
#' @param basketball_data the data frame we are using to do the manipulation
#'
#' @export
#' 

remove_func <- function(basketball_data) {
  basketball_data <- basketball_data %>% 
                        select(-V6, -V7)
  return(basketball_data)
}
```

```{r question3c}
basketball_data <- basketball_data %>% 
  select(-V6, -V7)

```


filtering all games played in 2022

```{r function3d1 0, eval = F}
#' Filtering all games played in 2022
#' 
#'
#' @param basketball_data the data frame we are using to do the manipulation
#'
#' @return return the dataset with only 2022 games
#' @export
#' 

func_2022_games <- function(basketball_data) {
  basketball_2022_data <- basketball_data %>% 
                            filter(as.Date(basketball_data$V1, format = "%m/%d/%Y") >=                                 as.Date("2022/01/01"))
  return(basketball_2022_data)
}
```


```{r function3d1 0, eval = F}
#' Function that will filter the tibble to only games played by a given team
#' 
#'
#' @param basketball_data the data frame we are using to do the manipulation
#' @param team_name the name of the team of whose games we want
#'
#' @export
#' 

team_func <- function(basketball_data, team_name) {
  basketball_data %>% 
    filter(grepl(team_name,V2) | grepl(team_name,V4))
}
```


```{r question3d}
basketball_2022_data <- basketball_data %>% 
  filter(as.Date(basketball_data$V1, format = "%m/%d/%Y") >= as.Date("2022/01/01"))

team_func <- function(team_name) {
  basketball_data %>% 
    filter(grepl(team_name,V2) | grepl(team_name,V4))
}
```


# team conference data
https://www.kaggle.com/c/mens-machine-learning-competition-2018/data
#got the data file from the above link
Manipulation code
First we join the tables with team names and conference names by team id
Next we will merge the table with the conference name and conference acronym using the
team_conference and Conferences table.

we want to arrange in descending order and group by year to get the most recent conference 
information for the team 

After this we want to merge our main dataset with the team conference dataset

```{r conference}
  team_conference <- as_tibble(inner_join(TeamConferences, Teams, by="TeamID"))
  team_conference <- as_tibble(inner_join(team_conference, Conferences, by = "ConfAbbrev"))
  team_conference <- team_conference %>% 
    group_by(LastD1Season) %>%
    arrange(desc(Season))
  team_conference <- subset(team_conference, LastSeasonID = "2018")
  team_conference <- team_conference %>% distinct()
  team_conference <- team_conference[,-c(1,2)]
  basketball_data$TeamName <- as.factor(basketball_data$TeamName)
  names(basketball_data)[2] <- "TeamName"
  inner_join(basketball_data, team_conference, by = "TeamName")
```


```{r}
devtools::document()
devtools::install()
library(basketballpackage)
getwd()
```
